## About Me
I'm a Data Science student currently persuing a Mcs. Degree at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. My main interests lie in machine learning and statistics.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching:
I am developing statistical models for time series regression in the presence of multiple (known) disruption events. My work involves using mixed models to analyze model properties and estimate the effect sizes of disruptions. I apply these methods to public health studies requiring a quasi-experimental approach, aiming to uncover insights into trends and intervention impacts.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Causal Inference, Econometrics and Statistics
- Generative AI and Diffusion Models

## ðŸŽ“ My previous elective studies:
- Image Processing and Computer Vision
- Classic NLP and Language Cognition in AI and humans
- Information Retrieval, e.g. classical methods and retrieval with LLMs
- Planning and Heuristic Search in Autonomous systems
- Graph Neural Networks, theory and modern architectures
- Time Series models, e.g. SARIMA and Prophet
