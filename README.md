## About Me
I'm a Data Science student currently persuing a Mcs. Degree at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. My main interest is in machine learning and statistic models.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching:
Modeling time series regression with multiple (known) disruption events, using statistical tools such as mixed models. Analysing model properties and the effect size of the disruptions on the time series. Applying my model on topical issues in public health questions requiring a quasi-experimental setup, aiming to provide insights into trends and effects of disruptions.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Causal Inference, Econometrics and Statistics
- Generative AI and Diffusion Models

## ðŸŽ“ My previous elective studies:
- Image Processign and Computer Vision, from classical algorithms to large models
- Classic NLP and Language Cognition in AI and humans
- Information Retrieval and RAG
- Planning and heuristic search in Autonomous systems
- Graph Neural Networks
- Time Series models

## âœ¨ Explore my projects:

### Machine Learning 
- **Image Search**: Implemented a retrieval pipeline for image search using Approximate-Nearest-Neighbours. Tested the effect of fine-tuning the similarity metric between images with Active Learning methods.
- **LinkedIn Dream Job Scorer**: Developed a product using random forest algorithms, Gemini API, and fine-tuned Facebook's RoBERTa.
- **GAN Model**: Created a Generative Adversarial Network for image generation, trained on the MNIST dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis Classifier**: Built a classifier trained on a Twitter dataset.
- **RAG Pipeline and Search Index**: Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline and search index.

### Statistical Projects
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzed and predicted wind power production using time series data.
- **Cardiovascular Diseases Study**: Conducted a 5-part project for a Statistics course, involving exploration and statistical analysis of a cardiovascular diseases dataset.

### Miscellaneous
- **Information Retrieval Presentation**: Presented on using BERT as a re-ranker in multi-stage retrieval systems.
- **Electronic Commerce Competitions**: Participated in competitions involving network dynamics, multi-armed bandits (MABs), and recommendation systems.
- **Data Structures Project**: Developed data structures from scratch.
- **IoT Heart Monitor**: Created an IoT heart monitor application using Arduino sensors.
