## About Me


## ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently researching:
Interrupted Time Series models with multiple interruption events, analyzing the model and calculating the effect size of the interruptions on the model.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Graph Neural Networks
- Advanced topics in classical AI and Planning
- Language cognition with ML tools

## âœ¨ look around my projects:

### Machine Learning 
- "LinkedIn Dream Job Scorer" product with random forest algorithms, Gemini API, finetuning Facebook's RoBERTa, etc.
- GAN model for generating images, trained on the MNIST dataset
- Sentiment Analysis classifier, trained on a Twitter dataset
- RAG pipeline and search index implementation

### Statistical Projects
- Time Series Analysis and prediction of a wind power production dataset 
- 5-part project for Statistics 2 course, covering exploration and statistical analysis for a cardiovascular diseases dataset

### Miscellaneous
- Electronic Commerce competitions: network dynamics, multi-armed bandits (MABs), recommendation systems
- Data Structures project from scratch
- IoT heart monitor application with Arduino sensors
